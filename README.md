# Pandas-Basics
Basic commands in pandas. This is for anyone who wants to use pandas library in python instead of Microsoft Excel/Microsoft Access to match data sets. It requires very less knowledge about python. This notebook does not have any information about scientific functions in numpy and pandas.

Alternative is to use python sqlite library to create a local database to match datasets.
